A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree in which each vertex has only up to 2 children that satisfies BST property: All vertices in the left subtree of a vertex must hold a value smaller than its own and all vertices in the right subtree of a vertex must hold a value larger than its own (we have assumption that all values are distinct integers in this visualization and small tweak is needed to cater for duplicates/non integer).
