//we do hashing for make 1-insert/2-delete/3-acess/4-search of elements about O(1)
//also if we have 3 objects obj1(ID=1206/name=khaled) obj2(ID=2205 ,name=eslam),obj3(ID=2535,Name=salma)
we want to store these 3 elements what can we do?
we can reserve an array of size more than biggest ID but this is bad as memory is wasted
so we go to concept of hashing we can say that last digit is the index of array we reserve 10 elments array
so there is a conflict between ID=2205 and ID=2535

solution 1-Replacement:delete last element and store new element
             2-open addresing(closed hashing):linear probing/quadratic probing(index + i^2)%10 
		if collison comes apply hashfn2;
            3-open hashing::with chaining of ocurse we have fixed size of array but each array is a list
		each index in array is called bucket
